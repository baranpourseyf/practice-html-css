        You've been my muse for a long time
        You get me through every dark night
        I'm always gone, out on the go
        I'm on the run and you're home alone
        I'm too consumed with my own life

        Are we too young for this?
        Feels like I can't move
        Sharing my heart, it's tearing me apart
        But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
        Doing what I can, tryna be a man

        And every time I kiss you, baby, I can hear the sound
        Of breaking down
        I've been confused as of late (yeah)
        Watching my youth slip away (yeah)
        You're like the sun, you wake me up
        But you drain me out if I get too much

        I might need room or I'll break
        Are we too young for this?
        Feels like I can't move
        Sharing my heart, it's tearing me apart
        But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now
        Doing what I can, tryna be a man

        And every time I kiss you, baby, I can hear the sound
        Of breaking down
        I don't want to play this part
        But I do, all for you
        I don't want to make this hard
        But I will 'cause I'm still

        Sharing my heart, it's tearing me apart
        But I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now (I know I would)
        Doing what I can, tryna be a man (be your man)
        And every time I kiss you, baby, I can hear the sound
        Of breaking down
